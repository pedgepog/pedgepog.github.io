                    <p class="leftalign">Dating Show Dating Sim is a game in development, drawing heavily from
                        Korean dating shows. Our main character, an heiress girl, appears on a Bachelor-like dating show 
                        to find a husband. The catch? One's painfully narcissistic, one's uncaring and
                        businesslike, one's a stalker, and one's just painfully uncommitted.
                    </p>
                    <p class="leftalign">You play as the female producer of the show, the person whom our main character
                        seeks help from. Your job is to guide her actions through this mess.
                    </p>
                    <p class="leftalign">But as her only source of emotional refuge in this disaster of a courting ritual, 
                        don't be surprised if you and our main character become more... emotionally entangled than you would 
                        have expected.
