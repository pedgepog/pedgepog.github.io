                    <p class="leftalign">Gold Cage is a stats-management
                        game in development about the price of maintaining power
                        to protect the ones you love.
                    </p>
                    <p class="leftalign">A duchess has long been pressured by the Queen
                        to marry a noble man. There's one problem - she's in love with her female knight and 
                        childhood friend.
                    </p>
                    <p class="leftalign">She has 3 days until she is officially married. Increasing her stats
                        will convince the Queen that she doesn't need marriage to maintain her power as a woman,
                        unlocking the choice to reject the engagement.
                    </p>
                    <p class="leftalign">But what she doesn't know is that if she calls off the engagement, the noble
                        man will kill her.
