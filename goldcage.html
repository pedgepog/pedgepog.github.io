                    <h2 class="leftalign">Gold Cage</h2>
                    <p class="leftalign">Gold Cage is a stats-management
                        game in development about the price of maintaining power
                        to protect the ones you love.
                    </p>
                    <p class="leftalign">A duchess has long been pressured by the Queen
                        to marry a noble man. There's one problem - she's in love with her female knight and 
                        childhood friend.
                    </p>
                    <p class="leftalign">She has 3 days until she is officially married. Increasing her stats
                        will convince the Queen that she doesn't need marriage to maintain her power as a woman,
                        unlocking the choice to reject the engagement.
                    </p>
                    <p class="leftalign">But what she doesn't know is that if she calls off the engagement, the noble
                        man will kill her.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="grid-container2">
                <div class="item">
                    <h2 class="leftalign">Process</h2>
                    <p class="leftalign">Mechanics: Reach 5 of each stat - 
                        intelligence, charm, command, status, and wealth.
                    </p>
                    <p class="leftalign">If goal is reached: The choice to refuse marriage will be unlocked, 
                        but that choice will lead to the Suitor killing the Player.
                    </p>
                    <p class="leftalign">Mechanics: Each day, Player (playing as the duchess) has 5 actions per day to increase their stats, 
                        and different actions in Map increases different stats.
                        <br>Per action: Stress +1 for each action that increases a stat, Stress -1 for each action taken to talk to other characters
                        <br>At Stress 5: Player passes out, Player action count decreases by 1
                        <br>Purpose: I wanted to show that attempting to maintain power through this stats-increasing is destructive, 
                        using the stress mechanic and the ultimate death of the protagonist when she chooses the choice that is unlocked by achieving certain stats.
